Firstly, I used SwiftUI over UIKit as I am more familiar with it and find it simpler to work with. This means I opted to use List over UITableView to display the data that appears after log in as SwiftUI's List contains the same basic functionalities as UITableView, just lacking a little customization.

Accounts are as follows (Format = Username: Password):

user: pass
helloworld: firstprogram
movielover: bestmovies

Each has a different list of items which is displayed depending on the account "logged-in".
